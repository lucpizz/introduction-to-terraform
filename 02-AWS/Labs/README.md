# 02-AWS Labs

These are the labs for the introduction to AWS.

## 01-Website

Using the AWS provider, create an s3 bucket and a website.

This mission will be complete when you have created a bucket and a website.

As a user, I should be able to go to a website url and get then html page. Notice this is not the s3 bucket url.
